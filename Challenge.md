1) Explain what's the difference between the `Internal API` and the `Public API` :

- ### Internal Api
The internal Api is exclusively for `Basecone` applications usage. Mainly used by the front-end (Webportal) to request actions to the back-end.

- ### Public Api
`Basecone` api exposed to the public. Used by 3rd party applications that want to use information/features made available by `Basecone`.
